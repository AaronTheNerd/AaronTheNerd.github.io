                                web servers. Additionally, Wireshark had to "capture" HTTP GET packet,
                                HTTP response packet, and measure the delay between GET and response
                                packets. The program also had to correctly handle one-hop HTTP
                                redirects. Additionally, the output had to be saved in an output file
                                (shown below).<br>

                                Description: Used a fast Fourier transfer method to create a simple
                                audio visualizer. In order to make the visualizer more visually
                                interesting we used a stacked bar graph to add dynamic colors and
                                "falling bars." In order to use the dynamic colors, the num_of_bars
                                variable in CLICK_ME.m can be changed to change the number of colors.
                                The color scaling works by using a pre-defined color map. The falling
                                bar was achieved by adding a bar the same color as the background and
                                having a matrix of "differences" which would slowly lower each
                                iteration. Unfortunately, it is difficult to record this as MatLab's
                                graphing functions tend to use a lot of processing power. Despite this,
                                I still embedded a video of the visualizer to show the concept.

                                method. This method was able to read, write, and stream bytes between
                                devices. Additionally, this implementation verified the WHO_AM_I values
                                of each device.

                                space in memory. For example, the syscall would give information about
                                whether or not the memory was occupied and whether the memory is
                                readable, writable, or executable. The syscall required a recompilation

                                Description: Created a Conway's Game of Life simulation with a GUI.
                                This was code that I made after my first year of college as such it
                                does not reflect my current abilities programming. The code has two
                                files: Cell.java and GOLGUI.java where Cell.java defines a Cell and
                                GOLGUI.java defines the GUI, the board of Cells, and the functions
                                updating the cells. If I were to do this again today there would be
                                three files: Cell.java, Board.java, GoLGUI.java. The code is ugly,
                                uncommented, and it has been too long since I made it to go back and
                                fix it. Despite this, I am still proud of this code, it was my first
                                time making a GUI by hand and I added a good amount of extra functions.
                                For example, the generation count, population number, the auto-run
                                feature, etc.
